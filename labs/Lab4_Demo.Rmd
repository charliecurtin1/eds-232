Let's explore how employee income and overtime hours worked affect likelihood of employee attrition.  Any predictions?

```{r}
#
data("attrition", package = "modeldata")

df <- attrition %>% mutate_if(is.ordered, factor, ordered = FALSE)

# Create training (70%) and test (30%) sets for the 
# rsample::attrition data.
set.seed(123)  # for reproducibility 
churn_split <- initial_split(df, prop = .7)
churn_train <- training(churn_split)
churn_test  <- testing(churn_split)
```

Let's set up set up our recipes now for preprocessing. 
```{r recipe}
#specify and prep recipe
churn_rec <- recipe(Attrition ~ ., data = churn_train) %>% 
  # binary encode Attrition, our outcome variable
  step_integer(Attrition, zero_based = TRUE) %>% 
  prep(churn_train)

#bake recipe with training data
churn_baked_train <- bake(churn_rec, new_data = churn_train)
```

```{r specify_models_glm}
#MonthlyIncome
# family = "binomial" since our target variable is binary
model_inc <- glm(data = churn_baked_train, Attrition ~ MonthlyIncome, family = "binomial")
  
#OverTime
model_time <- glm(data = churn_baked_train, Attrition ~ OverTime, family = "binomial")
```


```{r tidy_model_objs}
broom::tidy(model_inc)
broom::tidy(model_time)

```

```{r exp_coefs}
#exponentiate the coefficients from model objects for interpretation. Gives us changes in odds of attrition
# the odds of an employee attriting increase by .99 for every 1 additional dollar they make per month (so it's actually going down)
exp(coef(model_inc))

# if an employee works overtime, their odds of attriting increase multiplicatively by 3.48
exp(coef(model_time))

```


```{r recode_attrition_test}
# testing the generalization with our model
churn_baked_test <- bake(churn_rec, new_data = churn_test)
```

```{r plot_income_attrition}
ggplot(churn_baked_test, aes(x = MonthlyIncome, y = Attrition)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "glm", se = TRUE, method.args = list(family = binomial))

```

We can add more predictors, creating a multiple logistic regression model

```{r mult_log_regression}
# train our model with both predictors
model_both <- glm(Attrition ~ MonthlyIncome + OverTime, data = churn_train, family = "binomial")

# tidy model
broom::tidy(model_both)
```


```{r}
# plot 
ggplot(churn_baked_test, aes(x = MonthlyIncome, y = Attrition, color = OverTime)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "glm", se = FALSE, method.args = list(family = binomial)) +
  theme_bw()
```
